# geosummly - Geographic Summaries from Crowdsourced Data

[geosummly][geosummly] is as a framework that creates geographic summaries using the whereabouts of Foursquare users. Exploiting the density of the venue types in a particular region, the system adds a layer over any typical cartography geographic maps service, creating a first glance summary over the venues sampled from the Foursquare
knowledge base. Each summary is represented by a convex hull. The shape is automatically computed according to the venue densities enclosed in the area. The summary is then labeled with the most prominent category or categories. The prominence is given by the observed venue category density. A set of summaries are provided in the public [demonstration][demonstration].

## Architectural Overview 
The prototype is composed of 6 stages:
* sampling: it performs the sampling of Foursquare venues that are surrounded by a bounding box, and it records this information on a matrix;
* import: it generates a multidimensional tensor matrix, given the sampled data, where each dimension reports the magnitude of the Foursquare category venue, and each object shapes a portion (cell) of the original bounding box;
* discovery: it estimates the parameter minpts;
* clustering: it performs the clustering algorithm;
* evaluation: it computes the SSE and the Jaccard as evaluation means of the obtained clustering output;
* optimization: it performs two multi objective functions: linear and Pareto. 

Please refer to our [paper][paper] for a detailed description.

## Web UI
A web interface can be instantiated to visualize on a map the output of the geosummly.

    java -cp /path/where/geosummly/jar/is/located it.unito.geosummly.Server 8080
    
A set of pre-computed fingerprints will be shown. To add new ones, just copy the geojson of the clustering stage into the webroot/app/data folder, and then add the new location to webroot/app/js/config/config.js.
